# Using GitHub to host websites
# Your GitHub repositories are not only useful for storing, updating and collaborating on code files; 
# they can also be used to host static websites. This means that basic HTML documents can be delivered 
# using a URL provided by your GitHub repository. In this activity, you will explore two approaches to 
# building websites in GitHub by either creating HTML documents directly or using an existing template 
# site with Jekyll.
